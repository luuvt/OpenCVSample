## OpenCV

Those projects uses OpenCV version 4.2.
However, OpenCV binary isn't include in those projects.
You can get OpenCV binary by following steps.

### OpenCV for iOS

A binary version is available as it is.

1. Download `opencv-4.2.0-ios-framework.zip` from [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/4.2.0/opencv-4.2.0-ios-framework.zip](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/download/4.2.0/opencv-4.2.0-ios-framework.zip).
2. Unpack the file.
3. Copy `opencv2.framework` into `OpenCVSample_iOS` directory.

### OpenCV for macOS

No binary version, so you need to build a source version.

1. Prepare CMake. (e.g. `brew install cmake`)
2. Download `opencv-4.2.0.zip` from [https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.2.0.zip](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.2.0.zip).
3. Prepare a working directory. (e.g. `mkdir ~/foo`)
4. Unpack the file into the working directory.
5. Open terminal at the working directory. (e.g. `cd ~/foo`)
6. Run a build script by python 2. `python opencv-4.2.0/platforms/osx/build_framework.py osx`
8. Copy `osx/opencv2.framework` into `OpenCVSample_macOS` directory.
